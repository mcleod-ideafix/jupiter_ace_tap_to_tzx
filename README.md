# Jupiter ACE TAP to TZX file converter.
Quick and dirty translator from Jupiter ACE TAP files (not exactly the same as Spectrum TAP files) into TZX format. Just one source file. Compile as usual (no special library requirements). Use it from the command line with the full name of the TAP file to convert. The converted file will have .TZX appended to its name.
